Architecture
	1. Stop Guessing -> use auto scaling
	2. You can test at production scale
	3. Automate
	4. Project Evolving Architectures
	5. Game days for improving with users

Design Principles:
	1. Scalability
	2. Disposible Resources
	3. Automation: serverless, autoscaling, IaaS
	4. Loose Coupling (break it in components
	5. Services, not Servers

Web Architecture Framework: 6 pillars
	Synergy amoong them

	1. Operational Excellence
	  -) Code everywhere
	  -) Annotate Documentation (automatie)
	  -) Frequent changes
	  -) refine frequently
	  -) Anticipate failure and Learn from all opperational Failures

	  -) Prepare (Cloud formation, Config)
	  -) Operate (Cloud formation, Config)
	  -) Evolve (Cloud formation, Config, CI/CD)

	2. Security
	  -) Strong identity foundation
	  -) Enable treability
	  -) all layer
	  -) in transit and at rest
	  -) Keep people away from data
	  -) Security eventis (simulations)

	  -) Identity and Access Management (IAM
	  -) Detective Controls
	  -) Infrastructure Protection
	  -) Data Protection
	  -) Incident Response


	3. Reliability
		Service Quotas = Service Limites (old name)

	4. Performance Efficiency

	5. Cost Optimization
	  -) Awareness

	6. Sustainability
